# Handwritten Digit Recognition by building a Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains a **neural network framework built from scratch** (using only `numpy`) to classify handwritten digits.  
It demonstrates the fundamental steps of building, training, and evaluating a neural network without relying on high-level machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Features

- Define model architectures with:
  - `Linear` (fully connected) layers
  - `ReLU` activation
  - `Softmax` output
- **Training pipeline** with:
  - Cross-Entropy Loss
  - SGD Optimizer
  - Mini-batch gradient descent
- **Evaluation metrics**: accuracy and loss
- Forward & backward propagation implemented manually
